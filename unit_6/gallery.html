		        	<h2>The Actuary</h2>
		        	<p>My time with The Actuary magazine began two years after its inception. My first task was to improve on the original design, which was based on a square. The idea being that it represent the personality of a typical actuary. Also that the square was a mathimatic symbol and very symetric.</p>
				<p>After a year, the team working on The Actuary decided it was time for a redesign. I took the once serious and stuffy look of the magazine and morphed it into a design that was professional but still fun—to the point of featuring the famous arcade game character Pacman on the cover. The redesign was highly praised and well received by the staff and readers alike.</p>
				<p>Recently my role with the magazine has changed. I have become an art director/consultant. In this new role I oversee the process and ensure that quality and standards are met. The magazine’s look staying on brand is my number one concern.</p>
